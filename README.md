1. Within a Github actions that runs whenever code is pushed: This method prevents code that doesn't work from being pushed, and ensures that code doesn't just work on one machine and not another since everyones code is tested in the same environment (which could become a potential issue if you were to manually run tests locally).
2. No. Testing the output of a function in a vacuum does not require end-to-end testing. You would instead use a unit test.
3. Navigation mode analyzes a page after it reloads and provides an overall performance metric. Snapshop mode captures the current state of the page without reloading or navigating. It only runs audits that can be done on the static DOM. 
4. One: I would add a "<meta name="viewport">" tag in the head of my html tag as this dropped my SEO and Best Practices score. Two: I would optimize images as I could save a lot more on memory. Three: I would add a "<html lang="en"> tag to improve accessibility.
